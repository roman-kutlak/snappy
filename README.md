*SNAPPY*
========

This project is an online version of the program *SassyLogic* (https://bitbucket.org/rkutlak/sassylogic). The program was developed as a part of the EPSRC funded project Scrutable Autonomous Systems (SAsSy).

The program takes as an input First Order Logic formulas and translates them into English text. The program can also apply some basic simplifications so that complex formulas with redundancies can be simplified.
